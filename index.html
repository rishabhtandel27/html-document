    <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a <mark>distributed ledger</mark> with growing lists of <mark>records</mark> <i>
            (blocks)</i> that are securely linked together via <mark>cryptographic hashes</mark>.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
        Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a <mark>timestamp</mark>, and transaction data
        (generally represented as a <mark>Merkle tree</mark>, where <mark>data nodes</mark> are represented by leaves).
        Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare
        <mark>linked list</mark> data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
        Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given
        block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
        <br><br>
        Blockchains are typically managed by a <mark>peer-to-peer (P2P)</mark> computer network for use as a public
        <mark>distributed ledger</mark>, where nodes collectively adhere to a <mark>consensus algorithm protocol</mark>
        to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since
        <mark>lockchain forks</mark> are possible, blockchains may be considered <mark>secure by design</mark> and
        exemplify a distributed computing system with high <mark>Byzantine fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup></mark>

    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a
        cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
        Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered
        with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
        efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under
        their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in <em>The New York Times</em> every
        week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup>
        <br><br>
        The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto
        in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks
        without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the
        rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the following year by
        Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all
        transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup>

    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        <i>blocks</i> that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
        altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the
        participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A
        blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server.
        They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design
        facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a
        blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each
        unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has
        been described as a <i>value-exchange protocol</i>.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights
        because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and
        acceptance.[citation needed]
        <br><br>
        Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup>
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[25]</sup> and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Blocks</h2>
    <P>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<SUP>[3]</SUP> Each
        block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks
        form a chain.<sup>[3]</sup> This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way
        back to the initial block, which is known as the <em>genesis block</em> (Block 0).<sup>[26][27]</sup> To assure
        the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[28]</sup>
        <br><br>
        Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure
        hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so
        that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are
        called orphan blocks.<sup>[27]</sup> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from
        time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives
        a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their
        own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any
        particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the
        score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old
        blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<sup>[29]</sup> as
        more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.<sup>[3][30]: ch. 08 [31]</sup> For example,
        bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the
        valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of
        computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional
        segregated and parallel manner.<sup>[32]</sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Block time</h3>
    <p>The <em>block time</em> is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the
        blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is
        practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time
        for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.<sup>[33]</sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Hard forks</h3>
    <p><em>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) ยง Hard fork.</em></p>
    <p>A <em>hard fork</em> is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all
        users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network
        splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.
        <br><br>
        For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by
        exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and
        Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a
        rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
        cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.<sup>[34]</sup>
        <br><br>
        A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin
        Cash.<sup>[35]</sup> The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per
        second to accommodate for demand.<sup>[36]</sup>
